This macro scans the current buffer for the longest line.

soft-wrap doesn't affect which line is the longest.

It also detects "hard wrap". In Tools > Options > File Options > Load "Wrap line length". In cases other than simple SBCS/DBCS buffers Slick will break really long lines into shorter lines.

This function can detect these lines and will correctly find the real longest line.
